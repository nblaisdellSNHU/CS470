As someone who is pursuing a professional career as a software developer in some capacity, this course was directly in line with my goals, as we were able to build a fully-functional application, while also utilizing Amazon Web Services to make our app available through the cloud. As a software developer, I feel my strenghts lie in identifying small details, while also being able to conceptualize large systems at the same time. I could see myself in any kind of developer role, or even as a Solution Architect, for attempting to think about and build much larger systems.

One of the most beneficial learnings from this class was the ability to work with containers, and how to think about our applications as a series of microservices. That way, we can not only separate the logic of our applications into separate programs, which can each be deployed to the cloud, but also it helps for creating new projects in the future, or adding additional features to an existing project. By writing the new logic as a container, we can keep it separate from our existing application or feature while also having the tools to be able to connect that new microservice into the overall application.

For cost prediction, we can analyze the usage of our containers, but it will always depend on the acutal usage that our application realizes. On the other hand, if we make use of a cloud provider like AWS, we can make use of their cost savings and analysis tools to understand how much our services *would* cost if we were to run it on their infrastructure.

Lastly, elasticity is a hugely important aspect that we need to consider as we build our applications into the future. Especially as our projects start small, it makes sense to utilize tools like Lambda which only charge per invocation, but as our applications become larger, more complex and more popular, it might make sense to migrate to another type of infrastructure which is always running.
